## Welcome to my personal page!

I am a Physicist (2013 Cosmology/Astrophysics Ph.D) currently very interested in Complex Systems, Neuroscience Theory, Machine Learning and general mathematical modeling. After an academic journey, now I am CTO/CDO at Kognita Lab, an AI company with main focus on urban/geospatial modeling.
